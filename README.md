CLbundler
=========

A tool for creating and maintaining packages of pre-compiled libraries.

### Installation
Simply clone the repository to somewhere on your computer, and add the location of `CLbundler/bin` to the PATH environment variable.
To run CLbundler you will need Python >= 2.6.x < 3.x.

### Configuration
By default, CLbundler will download source code to `CLbundler/workspace/src_cache` and will create the builds in `CLbundler/workspace`. This can be changed in the configuration file: `CLbundler/CLbundler.cfg`
